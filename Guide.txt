Guide for the Financial Assistant Web App

1. Prerequisites
----------------
To run this app seamlessly and interactively, you must use a local web server. Browsers block JavaScript module imports from local files for security reasons.

2. How to Start a Local Server
------------------------------
You can use any of the following methods:

- **VS Code Live Server Extension**:
	1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.
	2. Right-click `FC.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
	3. The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:PORT/FC.html`.

- **Python (if installed)**:
	1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
	2. Run: `python -m http.server 8000`
	3. Open `http://localhost:8000/FC.html` in your browser.

- **Node.js (if installed)**:
	1. Install http-server: `npm install -g http-server`
	2. Run: `http-server`
	3. Open the provided local URL in your browser.

3. API Keys
-----------
API keys for Hugging Face and Gemini are already set in `aiApis.js`. No need to edit the HTML file for keys.

4. How to Use
-------------
- Open the app in your browser using one of the methods above.
- Enter your financial question in the chat input box.
- Select your preferred AI provider (Gemini or Hugging Face).
- Click "Send" or press Enter to get instant financial advice.
- Adjust your income and expenses in the calculator to see live savings and rate updates.

5. Troubleshooting
------------------
- If the chat does not work, make sure you are running from a local server (not opening the HTML file directly).
- Check the browser console (F12) for errors.
- Ensure your internet connection is active for API calls.
